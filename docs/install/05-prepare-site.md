# Prepare the site and join it to ACM

On this page you check the site and import it into ACM. The site's name in `clusters.yaml` becomes its ACM cluster
name. The `make` targets on this page work on the only site in your `clusters.yaml`. With several sites, add the
site's name, such as `make site-import SITE=SITE_NAME`.

If the cluster was a site of another hub, first [reuse it](#reuse-a-cluster-from-another-hub).

## Reuse a cluster from another hub

Let the site check tell you whether you need this section:

```sh
make site-check
```

If its `previous AI Grid install` line is `OK` (`none`, `leftover CRDs only; safe`, or `already a site of this hub`
when you rerun it after the import), skip to part 1. If it's
`FOUND`, it names what it found, such as a klusterlet (another hub manages the cluster) or a DataScienceCluster;
follow these steps first:

1. On the old hub, remove the site's labels, wait for its Applications to go, then delete its ManagedCluster. Delete
   its Argo CD cluster Secret and grid identity Secret (`redhat-ai-grid/grid-site-SITE`) if they stay behind.
2. Preview the wipe of the old install. It deletes nothing:

   ```sh
   make site-wipe
   ```

   Read the list. It must not name your platform's identity provider, cert-manager, NFD, the GPU operator or your
   ACME ClusterIssuers; the script protects those by name. If your platform uses other names, set them,
   space-separated, in `WIPE_PROTECT_NAMESPACES` and `WIPE_PROTECT_PACKAGES` (operator package names) for both runs.
3. Run the wipe. It leaves the cluster pull secret and image mirror, which the new hub delivers again:

   ```sh
   make site-wipe CONFIRM=1
   ```

Then run `make site-check` again. Its `previous AI Grid install` line should be `OK`.

## 1. Check the site's infrastructure

```sh
make site-check
```

You should see `OK` for `OpenShift 4.21 or later`, `default StorageClass`, `previous AI Grid install` and
`apps domain DNS`. The hub delivers the registry logins and image mirror once the site is imported. For GPU sites, see
[GPU operator and NFD](https://github.com/ai-grid-cloud/ai-grid-cluster-gitops/blob/9f4befd9e5716cea787c10661ddbf422a4999812/docs/install/spokes/openshift-ai.md#nvidia-gpu-operator-and-node-feature-discovery).

## 2. Import the site into ACM

Import the site:

```sh
make site-import
```

It runs the library's import script, which runs `clusteradm` against both clusters. It prints a summary of what it
will do and asks `Import SITE now? [y/N]`; read the summary and answer `y`. Any other answer changes nothing. Run
again for a site that's already joined and available, it says `already imported; nothing to do`.

The site joins ACM, and the hub's Argo CD registers it. The hub then prepares the site: it creates empty namespaces
for OpenShift AI and the grid, delivers the registry logins, labels the Submariner gateway nodes and starts
Submariner. OpenShift AI and the grid wait for the labels you add on the next page.

The import ends with `Import complete.` once the ManagedCluster has joined and the hub's Argo CD has its cluster
Secret for the site; the script waits for both.

To check the site again later:

```sh
make site-status
```

You should see `ManagedCluster: JOINED=True AVAILABLE=True`.

## Checkpoint

- The import printed `Import complete.`
