# Install the hub components

Argo CD now installs the selected components from the library at your pinned commit, and the template's own tenant
Keycloak. On this page you wait for them, create the console's secrets, and check the result.

## 1. Watch the components install

Check how the install is going:

```sh
make status
```

It prints the Applications that aren't `Synced` and `Healthy` yet, the MultiClusterHub's phase, Argo CD's
application controller with its restarts, the tenant Keycloak's Application, and the console's address once its Route
exists. It changes nothing. Run it again every few minutes. Every Application appears within a few minutes, and ACM
takes longest: the install is done when `MultiClusterHub: Running` shows, about 20 minutes after the bootstrap, and
only the three Applications below are listed.

If nothing changes for 10 minutes, or `make status` prints a line starting with `!!`, see
[troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md#nothing-installs-on-the-hub-the-argo-cd-controller-restarts-with-oomkilled).

These three wait for the first site to [join the grid](06-join-grid.md), and aren't a problem until then:

| Application | State | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `acm-submariner-local-cluster` | Progressing or Degraded | Submariner has no peer to connect to yet. |
| `limitador-redis` | OutOfSync or Degraded | Its ServiceExport CRD comes with Submariner. |
| `maas-db-local-cluster` | Degraded (ServiceExport) | No Globalnet address until a peer joins. |

## 2. Create the console's secrets

The provider console needs your catalog token for its git writer, and an admin login for the tenant Keycloak. Neither
goes in git. Wait until `make status` shows `tenant-idp: Synced Healthy` and a `Console:` address.

Then create the secrets:

```sh
AI_GRID_GIT_TOKEN_FILE=CATALOG_TOKEN_FILE KEYCLOAK_NAMESPACE=tenant-idp KEYCLOAK_REALM=tenants \
  scripts/create-console-secrets.sh
```

Replace `CATALOG_TOKEN_FILE` with the file that holds your catalog token, such as `~/.ai-grid/catalog-token`
([set up your deployment repository](02-repositories.md#2-create-your-catalog-repository-and-its-token)). The script prints no secret value, and
restarts the console to read the new Secrets. For every variable, and for a hub whose ingress certificate isn't
publicly trusted, see
[provider console](https://github.com/ai-grid-cloud/ai-grid-cluster-gitops/blob/f5dfd38e2f7c949b2d198476a4e3c5602186aee7/docs/install/hub/05-console-and-model-delivery.md#provider-console).

## 3. Verify

1. Check the hub:

   ```sh
   make status
   ```

   You should see only the three Applications from part 1, marked `waits for a site`, `MultiClusterHub: Running`,
   no `!!` line, and `Console: https://CONSOLE_HOST`.

2. Check that the console pod is up:

   ```sh
   scripts/with-cluster.sh hub oc get pods -n ai-grid-provider-console
   ```

   You should see the console pod `3/3 Running`. Open `https://CONSOLE_HOST` and sign in as a cluster admin.

## Checkpoint

- Every Application is `Synced` and `Healthy`, apart from the three that wait for a site.
- The MultiClusterHub is `Running`.
- The console opens and you can sign in.
