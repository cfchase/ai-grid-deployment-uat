# Install the hub components

Argo CD now installs the selected components from the library at your pinned commit, and the template's own tenant
Keycloak. On this page you wait for them, create the console's secrets, and check the result.

## 1. Watch the components install

Check how the install is going:

```sh
make status
```

It prints the Applications that aren't `Synced` and `Healthy` yet, the MultiClusterHub's phase, Argo CD's
application controller with its restarts, the tenant Keycloak's Application, and the console's address once its Route
exists. It changes nothing. Run it again every few minutes. Every Application appears within a few minutes. The
install takes about 20 minutes after the bootstrap, mostly for the tenant Keycloak: it's done when `make status`
shows `tenant-idp: Synced Healthy`, `MultiClusterHub: Running`, and no Application listed as not `Synced` and
`Healthy`.

If nothing changes for 10 minutes, or `make status` prints a line starting with `!!`, see
[troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md#nothing-installs-on-the-hub-the-argo-cd-controller-restarts-with-oomkilled).

Some Applications wait for the first site to [join the grid](06-join-grid.md), and aren't a problem until then:
`make status` lists them on one line, `Waiting for a site to join`. They're the Submariner, `limitador-redis` and MaaS
database Applications, which need a peer cluster, and any Application whose only unhealthy resources are ACM
Placements that match no ManagedCluster yet.

## 2. Create the console's secrets

The provider console needs your catalog token for its git writer, and an admin login for the tenant Keycloak. Neither
goes in git. Create the secrets:

```sh
AI_GRID_GIT_TOKEN_FILE=CATALOG_TOKEN_FILE KEYCLOAK_NAMESPACE=tenant-idp KEYCLOAK_REALM=tenants \
  scripts/create-console-secrets.sh
```

Replace `CATALOG_TOKEN_FILE` with the file that holds your catalog token, such as `~/.ai-grid/catalog-token`
([set up your deployment repository](02-repositories.md#2-create-your-catalog-repository-and-its-token)). The script prints no secret value, and
restarts the console to read the new Secrets. It first waits until the tenant Keycloak's Application `tenant-idp` is
`Synced` and `Healthy` and the console's Route exists, printing what it waits for, for up to 30 minutes; if it times
out, run `make status`. For every variable, and for a hub whose ingress certificate isn't
publicly trusted, see
[provider console](https://github.com/ai-grid-cloud/ai-grid-cluster-gitops/blob/f5dfd38e2f7c949b2d198476a4e3c5602186aee7/docs/install/hub/05-console-and-model-delivery.md#provider-console).

## 3. Verify

1. Check the hub:

   ```sh
   make status
   ```

   You should see no Application listed as not `Synced` and `Healthy` (the ones on the `Waiting for a site to join`
   line are fine), `MultiClusterHub: Running`, no `!!` line, and `Console: https://CONSOLE_HOST`. For about
   5 minutes after you create the secrets, `grid-bootstrap` can show `OutOfSync` while its root certificate is
   issued; run `make status` again.

2. Check that the console pod is up:

   ```sh
   scripts/with-cluster.sh hub oc get pods -n ai-grid-provider-console
   ```

   You should see the console pod `3/3 Running`. Open `https://CONSOLE_HOST` and sign in as a cluster admin.

## Checkpoint

- Every Application is `Synced` and `Healthy`, apart from the ones that wait for a site.
- The MultiClusterHub is `Running`.
- The console opens and you can sign in.
